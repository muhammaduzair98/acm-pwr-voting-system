**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Yes actually we need a user authentication, in which session will start for the each user and allow them to cast the vote. In addition to this, it will store the date/time for each user once they get to the vote casting screen as well as store the name of the user.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I think, we can add some predefined login credentials matching with student/user Roll No. For Example:

Username: 166002
Passwrod: ****** (Any Unique Passwords we will store for each user which we will use for validation purposes)

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
N/A
